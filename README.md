# Human-Detection-with-Heat-map
An application that detects humans from a camera and presents the population desity as a heap map.
Utilizes YOLO, OpenCV, and other Machine Learning Libraries for detecting human objects accurately. 

## Installation
Libraries required:

Import library needed for this project.
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv
import imutils #image processing

Include pip install instructions
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python


## Usage
How do users use your program/code
```
$ python3 main.py

```
### Testing

The program will ask for permission to laptop's camera.

The camera window will pop up named "frame" and green box will identify the objects in frame.

### Utilizing a webcam / camera

In progress

## Features

What are some of the features of the projects. What can people do and how to use it. 
1. Camera
>  > Detector people in static or motion.
>  > Set more than one camera. Different view points. Will the camera recongize the same human and only count 1.
3. Sensors
4. Heat Map

## Sample Image
Put some screenshots if applicable. 

## Roadmap
1. Using CVAT, an open-source image and video annotation tool, to accurately detect humans only.
2. Gather human count from each camera frame and store in database.
3. Generate heatmap based on the data.
